Package: python-ceilometer
Architecture: all
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, ${python:Depends}
Description: ceilometer python libraries
 Ceilometer aims to deliver a unique point of contact for billing systems to
 aquire all counters they need to establish  customer billing, accross all
 current and future OpenStack components. The delivery of counters must
 be tracable and auditable, the counters must be easily extensible to support
 new projects, and agents doing data collections should be
 independent of the overall system.

 of ceilometer
