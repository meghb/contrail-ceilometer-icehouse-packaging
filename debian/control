Description: ceilometer python libraries
 Ceilometer aims to deliver a unique point of contact for billing systems to 
 aquire all counters they need to establish  customer billing, accross all 
 current and future OpenStack components. The delivery of counters must 
 be tracable and auditable, the counters must be easily extensible to support 
 new projects, and agents doing data collections should be 
 independent of the overall system.

 of ceilometer
